\DOC CONSTRUCTION_TO_TERM

\TYPE {CONSTRUCTION_TO_TERM : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns theorem asserting that the syntactical structure of a term is equivelant to it's quotation

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality, construction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONSTRUCTION_TO_TERM} maps any term {`EpsilonConstruction(t)`} to the corresponding theorem {|- EpsilonConstruction(t) = Q_ t _Q} where {EpsilonConstruction} are elements of the {Epsilon} type that represent the syntax of {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails if there exists any subterm inside the term that is not of type epsilon

\EXAMPLE
{
# CONSTRUCTION_TO_TERM `App
  (App
  (QuoConst "\\/"
  (TyBiCons "fun" (TyBase "bool")
  (TyBiCons "fun" (TyBase "bool") (TyBase "bool"))))
  (QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool")))
  (QuoConst "F" (TyBase "bool"))`;;
val it : thm =
  |- App
     (App
      (QuoConst "\\/"
      (TyBiCons "fun" (TyBase "bool")
      (TyBiCons "fun" (TyBase "bool") (TyBase "bool"))))
     (QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool")))
     (QuoConst "F" (TyBase "bool")) =
     Q_ (T \/ F) _Q
}
